# 📘 Week 1 – Full 7-Day Streak of Real-World Learning & Projects

## ✅ What I Worked On

| Day | Focus Area | What I Did |
|-----|------------|------------|
| **Day 1** | 🔧 **DevFlow Kickoff (Backend)** | Set up Node.js backend, built OTP + JWT Auth |
| **Day 2** | 📩 **Scalable Email Verification** | Redis + BullMQ + bcrypt for async OTP handling |
| **Day 3** | 🖼️ **Image Compressor** | Built full in-browser image tool with Next.js + Sharp |
| **Day 4** | 🧠 **SQL Deep Dive** | ACID, Transactions, Isolation Levels, Normalization |
| **Day 5** | 📚 **DSA Revision I** | Max, even/odd, fibo, palindrome, bubble sort, 2nd max |
| **Day 6** | 🧠 **DSA Revision II** | Missing number (sum + XOR), Sets, Kadane’s Algo, Merge sorted arrays |
| **Day 7** | 🔁 **DSA Round III** | Continued revision, practiced factorial, frequency map, digit sum |

## 📚 What I Learned

### ✅ Backend & Architecture
- OTP + JWT = secure & stateless auth
- Redis TTL + BullMQ keeps Node.js non-blocking and scalable
- Worker queues help avoid event loop blocking

### ✅ Frontend Performance
- Image compression using `sharp` reduced 3MB → 60KB
- Live preview with slider = user-friendly & efficient UI

### ✅ SQL Mastery
- ACID rules apply in UPI, banking, seat booking, etc.
- Isolation levels like `REPEATABLE READ` vs `SERIALIZABLE` now make real sense
- Normal forms prevent data mess in growing DBs

### ✅ DSA Patterns Reinforced
- Two pointers (reverse, palindrome, merge arrays)
- HashMap (frequency count, 2nd max)
- Math logic (XOR, sum formulas, digit sum)
- Kadane’s Algorithm = real DP thinking

## ❌ Blockers
- Some off-by-one bugs in 2-pointer problems
- Remembering XOR logic for missing number
- Needed to reread SQL concurrency topics to understand anomalies

## 🧠 Reflection
I *showed up* every single day this week — and not just for tutorials.  
I **built**, **debugged**, **revised**, and most importantly: **understood**.  
Week 1 wasn’t about doing more, it was about doing it **intentionally** and **clearly**.
