# 📘 Day 5 – Core DSA Pattern Revision

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Revisited 8 essential DSA problems, focusing on logic behind each
- Wrote down edge cases and dry-ran each problem
- Practiced by hand + IDE to reinforce patterns

## 📚 What I Learned
| Problem | Pattern / Concept |
|--------|-------------------|
| Max in Array | Linear scan (compare & track) |
| Even/Odd | Use `% 2` to check parity |
| Reverse Array | Two-pointer swap method |
| Prime Check | Loop till `√n` for efficiency |
| Fibonacci | Simple loop, track `a` and `b` |
| 2nd Max | Track max and second max separately |
| Palindrome | Two pointers inward comparison |
| Bubble Sort | Repeated swaps until sorted |

Each of these teaches **classic logic + patterns** like:
- Loop control
- Pointer movement
- Condition-based decisions
- Optimization by bounds

## ❌ Blockers
- Initially missed edge cases like:
  - Reversing odd-length arrays
  - Negative numbers for max
  - Prime of 1 and 0

## 🧠 Reflection
Solving DSA problems is great — but today I realized **understanding the "why" and the "how"** behind each approach is 10x more powerful. These core problems form the foundation for every complex question that comes later.
