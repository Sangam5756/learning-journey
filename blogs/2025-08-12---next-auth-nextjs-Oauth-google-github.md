# Day 26 ‚Äì Implementing Multi-Provider Authentication with NextAuth

## ‚úÖ What I Worked On

- Set up authentication in a Next.js project using **NextAuth**.
- Integrated **Google OAuth**, **GitHub OAuth**, and a **custom credentials provider**.
- Configured `.env.local` for storing API keys and secrets.
- Implemented `jwt` and `session` callbacks to attach a `uid` to the session.
- Solved three linked list problems for DSA practice:
  - Add Two Numbers ‚Äì Implemented addition using linked lists to simulate digit-by-digit summation.
  - Remove Nth Node from End ‚Äì Used a two-pointer technique to achieve single-pass removal.
  - Merge Two Sorted Lists ‚Äì Merged two sorted linked lists into one without creating new nodes.

## üìö What I Learned

- How to configure multiple authentication providers in `NEXT_AUTH_CONFIG`.
- Using callbacks to customize the JWT and session objects.
- How OAuth apps on GitHub and Google require correct callback URLs.

## ‚ùå Blockers

- Initially got stuck with the `client_id is required` error for GitHub because my `.env` variable names didn‚Äôt match my code.
- Spent some time debugging why `process.env` values were coming up `undefined` ‚Äî solved it by restarting the dev server after editing `.env.local`.

## üß† Reflection

Today I did Next.js authentication setup .  
Now I have three working sign-in methods ‚Äî Google, GitHub, and custom credentials ‚Äî all feeding into a unified session object.  
The main lesson: **90% of "NextAuth is broken" problems are just environment variable typos or callback URL mismatches**.  
Next up, I want to secure API routes and create a polished login UI so the experience is smooth for real users.
