# 📘 Day 3 – Real-World Image Compressor (Built from Internship Need)

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Built a blazing-fast, in-browser **Image Compressor**
- Used `Next.js (App Router)` with server-side image optimization via `sharp`
- Added live compression preview with a slider for user control
- Ensured mobile & desktop support with responsive UI
- Deployed on custom domain: [compressit.sangammundhe.site](https://compressit.sangammundhe.site)

## 📚 What I Learned
- Real impact of large image uploads on dashboard performance
- How to use `sharp` in Next.js API routes for efficient server-side image compression
- S3-like optimizations in small-scale projects
- Tailwind + TypeScript patterns for building clean UI quickly

## ❌ Blockers
- Sharp’s memory usage under heavy compression loads
- mobile image preview bugs

## 🧠 Reflection
This wasn’t just another tool — I *built it to solve a real pain point during my internship*. Banners were taking ~4MB and tanking UX. Now with this, images go from **3MB → 60KB** without loss of quality. Feels amazing to ship something useful 🚀
