# 📘 Day 6 – More Core DSA Patterns & Problem Solving

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Solved & revised 7 more fundamental DSA problems
- Focused on how logic works under the hood, not just syntax
- Applied pattern recognition to reduce brute-force thinking

## 📚 What I Learned

| Problem | Pattern / Concept |
|--------|-------------------|
| Sum of Digits | Use `% 10` to extract digits, `/ 10` to reduce number |
| Factorial | Loop-based multiplication |
| Merge 2 Sorted Arrays | Two-pointer technique |
| Count Frequency | Use `HashMap` to map element → count |
| Missing Number | Use `sum of n` formula or XOR logic |
| Remove Duplicates | Use `Set` to eliminate repeats |
| Max Subarray Sum | Kadane’s Algorithm (dynamic programming) |

> Kadane’s Algorithm stood out — it feels magical how a greedy local sum helps track global max subarray!

## ❌ Blockers
- Remembering the XOR trick for missing number required extra practice
- Off-by-one mistakes in two-pointer merges

## 🧠 Reflection
DSA is starting to feel intuitive now. I’m seeing how many problems reuse similar ideas: pointers, hash maps, or math. Understanding the **underlying patterns** is 100x more effective than memorizing solutions.
