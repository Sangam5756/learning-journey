# Day 21 ‚Äì Component Work, TypeScript Revision & DSA Practice

## ‚úÖ What I Worked On
- Continued building DevFlow frontend
  - Refactored and polished multiple UI components
  - Improved layout responsiveness
- Revised TypeScript interview questions
  - Focused on advanced types, utility types, and generics
- Practiced key DSA problems

## üìö What I Learned
- React component best practices with clean JSX & prop typing
- Deep dive into:
  - `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Record<K, T>`
  - Union vs Intersection types
  - Discriminated unions for safe type narrowing
- Reinforced core DSA techniques with edge case testing

## ‚ùå Blockers
- Still wrapping my head around when to use type guards vs narrowing with `in`, `typeof`, `instanceof`
- Some doubts on optimal TypeScript types for component props

## üß† Reflection
TypeScript is powerful but requires consistent practice ‚Äî reviewing these concepts boosted my confidence for upcoming interviews. Also happy with UI progress on DevFlow. Every day of consistent work is compounding. üöÄ
