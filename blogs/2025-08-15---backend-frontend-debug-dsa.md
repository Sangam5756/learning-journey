# Day 28 ‚Äì Frontend and Debugging


**‚úÖ Work Done**

* Frontend: Fixed ESLint warnings, debugged API route types, implemented NextAuth credential login with server-only tokens, built dynamic user profile page, handled cross-domain cookies, added toast notifications.
* DSA Practice: Check Even/Odd, Multiplication Table, Sum of Naturals & Squares, Swap Numbers, Closest Number, Dice Problem, Nth Term of AP.

**üìö Key Learnings**

* Next.js 15+ API routes require `await params`.
* Server-only tokens improve security; TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors.
* Cross-domain cookies need `SameSite=None` and `Secure`.
* Mathematical formulas optimize iterative solutions; multiple swap techniques; edge case handling.

**‚ùå Blockers**

* Route param mismatches, NextAuth session config, TypeScript strict types, ESLint deps rules.
* Overthinking simple DSA problems, forgetting edge cases, formula mix-ups.

**üß† Reflection**
Next.js 15 brings breaking changes; careful state management, async handling, and error feedback are key. DSA practice complements frontend debugging and builds problem-solving confidence.
