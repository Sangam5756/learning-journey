# Day 24 – Swagger API Documentation

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Integrated Swagger JSDoc and Swagger UI for live API documentation
- Added multi-environment server configuration (local + production)
- Implemented `bearerAuth` scheme for JWT authentication
- Documented all API routes with request/response schemas

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure Swagger documentation for better readability
- Configuring multiple server URLs for different environments
- Defining authentication schemes in API docs

## ❌ Blockers
- Needed extra time to write detailed schema definitions

## 🧠 Reflection
Swagger transforms backend APIs into an interactive playground, making it easier for developers to explore and test endpoints directly.
