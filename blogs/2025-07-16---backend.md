# 📘 Day 1 – Kickstarting DevFlow Q&A Platform

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Set up the foundational backend using Node.js + Express
- Initialized DevFlow project structure
- Implemented basic authentication system with OTP and JWT
- Pushed initial commit to GitHub

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to architect a real-world backend project from scratch
- Flow of OTP-based login and JWT token generation
- Importance of clean modular structure for long-term scalability

## ❌ Blockers

- Minor issues in OTP expiry logic
- Handling async email service integration (EmailJS)

## 🧠 Reflection

Starting DevFlow from the ground up without any tutorials is challenging but exciting. I’m doing this to understand _how real apps work_ — not just copy code. This first step already helped me grasp the authentication flow deeply.
