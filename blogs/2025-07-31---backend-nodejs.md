## ✍️ Writing Habits

- 🕐 **Daily**: Log what I did, learned, and struggled with  
  → Written after each coding session (`logs/YYYY-MM-DD---topics.md`)

- 📆 **Weekly**: Reflect on progress every Sunday or Monday  
  → Summary of the week's highlights and low points (`reviews/week-XX.md`)

- 📦 **Project Logs**: Document project planning, building, and lessons  
  → Track major side projects (`projects/project-name.md`)
