# 📘 Day 4 – Node.js Routing & Middleware

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Built backend routes for login and registration
- Connected MongoDB Atlas to backend
- Wrote custom middleware for input validation

## 📚 What I Learned
- How Express handles middleware chaining
- JWT authentication basics
- Structuring routes using modular folders (`/api/v1/` style)

## ❌ Blockers
- Faced a bug while decoding JWT token due to secret mismatch

## 🧠 Reflection
Feeling much better with Node.js. Folder structure feels natural now, and middleware chaining in Express makes a lot of sense.
