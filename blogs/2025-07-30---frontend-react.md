# 📘 Day 3 – React Hooks & Controlled Components

## ✅ What I Worked On
- Created login and signup forms using `useState`
- Implemented input validation logic

## 📚 What I Learned
- Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components
- Basics of `useEffect` and side effects in React
- How to manage state using functional updates

## ❌ Blockers
- Slight confusion with debounce timing in input fields

## 🧠 Reflection
Today was productive!  
I feel more confident using `useState` and managing form data in real-time. Still need to dive deeper into `useEffect` and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
